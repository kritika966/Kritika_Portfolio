### Summary
Home Credit focuses on helping people who don't have access to traditional banking services and might have little or no credit history. Our project's goal is to lower the chances of rejecting loan applications by using advanced data analysis to better predict how likely customers are to pay back their loans. This process includes pulling together information from different sources, such as phone data, transaction records, and credit bureau reports.

### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to create a strong analysis system that uses both descriptive and predictive methods to check how likely it is that potential borrowers will be able to pay back their loans. By using data from different sources, the project aims to make it easier for more people to get loans, protect customers from unfair lending practices, and ensure that lending is done fairly and securely. The ultimate aim is to use these models to better predict loan repayment behaviors, helping to make smarter lending decisions and reduce the financial risks of lending to people who are often overlooked by traditional banks.

### Solution
In our group project, we tackled the challenge of predicting who might not repay loans using a dataset that had more people who repay loans than those who don't. To balance this, we adjusted the data, making it fairer for model training. We started with a basic logistic regression model, moved to a more complex random forest model, and finally settled on the XGBoost model, which gave us the best results. This model helps us better identify who might struggle to repay, ensuring loans are given more responsibly and supporting our goal to help more people access fair financial services without facing rejection.

### Contribution
In our group project, I focused on EDA, data cleaning, analysis, debugging the code, and ensuring everything ran smoothly, which helped us handle our data analysis more effectively. I contributed actively to the team by resolving issues quickly and was always available to help my teammates with any problems they encountered. Together, our collaboration allowed us to tackle complex tasks efficiently and successfully achieve our project goals.

### Business Values
1. **Improved Loan Accessibility**: Used statistical models to evaluate how likely people are to repay loans by analyzing data with various predictors. This approach helps decrease the number of loan rejections for people who usually don't have enough credit history.
2. **Risk Management**: Can get exact information of a customer's financial situation by incorporating data from different sources like phone records, transaction history, and traditional credit reports. This method helps reduce the risk of defaulting the loan.
3. **Operational Efficiency**: The analytics approach used predictive modeling, which makes the loan process more efficient by lowering the time and effort needed to review loan applications. This not only saves money for the company but speeds up the rate of loan approval.
5. **Promotion of Financial Inclusion**: The solution helps more people get access to credit, especially those who are usually left out by traditional banks because they don't have a credit history.
6. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: By using infsights from past records and alternative data sources, we can make well-informed and equitable lending decisions.

### Challenges
Our group faced some challenges with large dataset, which slowed down our model processing times significantly. To overcome this, we divided the tasks and each worked on different models independently. This approach allowed us to manage the computational load more effectively and improve our overall efficiency.

### Learnings
During the project assignment, I gained valuable skills in performing detailed data analysis and extracting meaningful insights from the data. I also learned about the concepts of modeling and the critical role that teamwork plays in achieving project goals.
